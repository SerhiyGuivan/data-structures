# Searching Algorithms in JavaScript

## What is a Search Algorithm?

Search algorithms are used to retrieve some information stored in a data structure.

For example, we could search an array (the data structure) for the value 8 (some information).

Usually, a searching algorithm will return the position of the found value, or if it isn’t found, it will return -1.

So, if we searched ``[1, 2, 3]`` for the value 2, then we’d get back 1 – the index of the found value.

If we searched the same array for 5, we’d get back -1; i.e. value not found.
